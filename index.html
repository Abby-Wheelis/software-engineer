<h1>
Mayukoâ€™s Essential Abilities and the CSC 160 Syllabus
</h1>
<p>
Mayuko mentioned that soft skills were very important in the field, in addition to technical skills. 
  Our syllabus outlines soft skills that are required for sucess. These include:
  <ul>
    <li> Arriving to class on time with the necessary materials, which demonstrates respect for the professor and fellow students</li>
    <li> Using the same software as peers, thus increasing the ability to <em> empathize </em>, something that Mayuko stressed was important in the video.</li>
     <li> Mayuko also emphasized the importance of productive and constructive peer to peer collaboration, guidlines for collaboration which could make a good addition to the syllabus or in-class discussion. </li>
  </ul>
