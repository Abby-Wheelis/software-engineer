Mayukoâ€™s Essential Abilities and the CSC 160 Syllabus
</h1>
<p>
Mayuko mentioned that soft skills were very important in the field, in addition to technical skills. 
  Our syllabus outlines soft skills that are required for sucess. These include:
  <ul>
    <li> Arriving to class on time with the necessary materials, which demonstrates respect for the professor and fellow students</li>
    <li> Using the same software as peers, thus increasing the ability to <em> empathize, </em> something that Mayuko stressed was important in the video.</li>
     <li> Mayuko also emphasized the importance of productive and constructive peer to peer collaboration, guidlines for collaboration which could make a good addition to the syllabus or in-class discussion. </li>
  </ul>
  Mayuko also mentions that she was surprised by the amount of her work that was collaborative. This idea is well represented in the syllabus because we will be working in partners.
  Collaboration played into Mayuko's work life in the following ways:
  <ul>
    <li> She brainstormed with peers in order to develop and improve the platform. </li>
    <li> She also mentions that she works with peers that are both software engineers and those who play other roles, such as product management and design.  </li>
    <li> Another element of her life that Mayuko mentioned was that she engages in peer reviews, where other software engineers look over her code and approve it.</li>
  </ul>
  These elements of collaboration are prominent in the syllabus, as we will both be working on labs and projects in pairs, and that we will be reviewing one anothers homework assignments.
  </p>
  <p>
    The final element that stood out to me in Mayuko's speech was that all types of people can be successful software engineers. One of her main points with this commentary was that it was important to stay true to herself, and not try to fit a certain mold or sterotype.
    This observation interested me because I find it important to be genuine to oneself in all aspects of life.
